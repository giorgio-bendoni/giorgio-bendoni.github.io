<h1> My work flow</h1>

I am always looking at new ways to produce and irganise my output.

My key principle is that we tend to produce output (a report, an essay, an article) accepting the constraint that it has to fit into and A4 sheet to be printed and read in that shape, even if the great majority of documents are no longer being printed and are read of screen that do not meet the A4 standards.

In addition to that, I try to use software which is open source and which does not over complicate the process of producing written output. In summary, I avoid packages such as MS Office or Google Docs as they force the acceptance of pre-set standards and limit creativity and focus by forcing editing and tipographic choice
while in the phase of creating content.

As such, my written documents are produced in Markdown, to be then converted, as necessary, in html or pdf.
