<br>      
<h5>Module overview</h5>
<hr>
This is a Level 5 core module for the course _BSc Economics, Finance and Banking_. This is an optional module for Level 6:
+ BA Economics and Management
+ BA European Business
+ BSc Business Economics
+ BSc Economics

There are no prerequisites to attend this course, as students will have studied relevant introductions to macroeconomics and quantitative methods at level 4.  

This module is a very popular option at level 5 as it provides wide and strong foundations in the area of banking, financial markets, central banking and monetary policy. 

The content of this module is delivered over two separate streams:
+ **Monetary Policy (MP)** - This stream deals with the role of central banks and monetary policy and their impact on the economy. This stream introduces a limited number of formal (mathematical) models and relies mostly on the logical development of arguments
+ **Financial Markets (FM)** - This stream deals with the general structure, functioning and management of financial markets and institutions, including risks, regulations and crises. This stream introduces a number of formal (mathematical) models and relies on the understanding of their logic and on the ability to apply them to realistic scenarios.
