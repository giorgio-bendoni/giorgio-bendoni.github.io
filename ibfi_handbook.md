<h3>International Banking and Financial Instruments</h3>
<hr />
<br>      
<h5>Module overview</h5>
<hr />
This is a Level 6 core module for the course _BSc Economics, Finance and Banking_, C1826S. This is an optional module for Level 6:
+ BA Economics and Management, C2413S
+ BA European Business, C2275F
+ BSc Business Economics, C1823S
+ BSc Economics, C1824S

This is a very popular module at Level 6 due to the breadth of topics and the connections to current issues in international banking management and operations. The module is accessible to students who have not previoulsy done a banking course as there will be a concise introduction to banking in the first part of the term. The required level of mathematical skills is the one normally acquired through the quantitative methods and data analysis course attended at Level 4 and 5 of the BA Economics & Management. BSc students will have attended full years courses in Mathematics and Statistics at Level 4 and Econometrics and Data research methods at Level 5, hence they will be equipped with the necessary skills.

In short, the essence of international banking is about (1) operating across jurisdictions (legal, legislative, regulatory, monetary) and (2) facing exposure to a variety of risks (country, sovereign, geopolitical, climate) in addition to the three main categories of credit, market and operational risk.

In the stream **International Banking** we will review the basic functioning of banking and monetary systems, to then explore the opportunities and challenges of international operations, and to finally examine risk management in the context of Global-Sistemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The exposure to the relevant, deriving risks will require the introduction of mitigating measures such as regulatory compliant capital and liquidity; at operational elevel, such mitgating measures will constitute the core of the stream **Financial Instruments**, in which we will introduce, discuss and apply swaps, options, forward and futures, for example, to realistic scenarios.

2. Organise and present appropriate data to frame a problem in the area of banking and finance and identify a solution.
3. Show understanding of the issues surrounding the effective regulation of financial systems.
4. Implement strategies involving financial derivatives in measurement and management of financial risk, hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.
5. Critically evaluate and demonstrate knowledge of the empirical research literature in the area
<br><br>
<h5>Teaching and planned activities</h5>
<hr>
The module is delivered via a combination of 22 lectures and 22 seminars over one term of 11 weeks. The programme is structured such that the two streams (International Banking and Financial Instruments) are delivered in parallel.<br>
**Lectures** concentrate on introducing concepts,theories, information and practices relevant to international banking and financial instruments.<br>
**Seminars** are structured to develop an understanding of the material introduced in the lectures, to offer opportunities for formative assessment in practicing techniques introduced in the lectures and to critically review contemporary issues.
