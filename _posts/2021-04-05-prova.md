When discussing asset bubbles in class, I introduce the question as to whether CB should recognize and prick such bubbles. In both cases, the answer is _no_.

Credit-driven asset bubbles are market conditions in which a specific type of assets experiences increasing prices beyond its _normal_ value.

Following the dot-com bubble burst of the year 2000 and the recession of 2001, the Federal Reserve maintained a expansionary montetary policy stance that achieved very low effective funds rates (see Fig. 1).

At the same time _core inflation_ displayed a decreasing trend (see Fig. 2), which never required a reversal of the monetary policy stance.

Incentivised by low interest rates, private residential fixed investments increased at a higher rate (see Fig. 3) then before the 2001 recession. As demand increased at faster rate than supply, fueled by easy credit conditions, prices of houses started to increase. In some areas they increased very quickly (see Fig. 3). In such conditions, government entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddi Mac guaranteed mortgages even to subprime borrowers who would have not qualified

In same areas, however, prices did not increase that dramatically (see Fig. 4)

When inflation started to increase, at the end of 2003, the Federal Reserve started to consdier a tightening of their monetary policy and finallhy increased the Fed Funds Rate Target in 2004 (see Fig. 5).

Much has been said about the 2008 recession but the [key points][1] are the following:
+ The subprime mortgage crisis started in 2007 when the housing industry’s asset bubble burst.
+ With the previous years’ increasing home values and low mortgage rates, houses were bought not as places to live in, but as investments.
+ Government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guaranteed mortgages, even if they were subprime or those lent to people who wouldn’t normally qualify for loans
+ Since the financial industry heavily invested in mortgage-backed derivatives, the housing industry’s downturn became the financial industry’s catastrophe.
+ The 2007 financial crisis ushered in the 2008 Great Recession.
