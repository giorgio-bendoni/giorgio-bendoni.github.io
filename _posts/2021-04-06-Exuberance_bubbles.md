In a separate post I have mentioned the dot-com bubble, whose inflating started in the mid-1990s and finally burst in 2000; this lead to a short recession and a 2-year growth stagnation in the USA.

That bubble was caused by irrational exuberance, to be interpreted as overly optimistic expectations of returns from investments in specific types of asset. The bubble involved tech companies listed at NASDAQ.

Exuberance-driven bubble are of interest under the perpectives of efficient markets, rational expectations and behavioural economics.

The objective here is to simply display what the bubble looked like (figure 1).
