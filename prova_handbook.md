## International banking and financial instruments

### Module overview

This is a Level 6 core module for the course _BSc Economics, Finance and Banking_. This is an optional module for Level 6:
+ BA Economics and Management
+ BA European Business
+ BSc Business Economics
+ BSc Economics

This module is very popular due to the breadth of topics and the connections to current issues in international banking management and operations. There are no prerequisites:
+ a concise introduction to banking will assist students who have not previously taken a banking course;
+ the mathematics and quantitative methods skills developed at Level 4 will be adequate to understand and apply the financial instruments introduced in the programme.

In short, the essence of international banking is about (1) operating across jurisdictions (legal, legislative, regulatory, monetary) and (2) facing exposure to a variety of risks (country, sovereign, geopolitical, climate) in addition to the three main categories of credit, market and operational risk. In such circumstances, it is necessary to have an understanding of the regulatory and operational frameworks and of the suitability of selected financial instruments to effectively hedge against risk and to optimise the outcome of financial transactions.

In the stream **International Banking** we will review the basic functioning of banking and monetary systems, to then explore the opportunities and challenges of international operations, and to finally examine risk management in the context of Global-Sistemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The exposure to the relevant, deriving risks will require the introduction of mitigating measures such as regulatory compliant capital and liquidity; at operational elevel, such mitigating measures will constitute the core of the stream **Financial Instruments**, in which we will introduce, discuss and apply swaps, options, forward and futures, for example, to realistic scenarios.


### Aims
1. To outline the difficulties and opportunities of financial risk management and banking on an international scale.
2. To investigate comparative institutional and policy approaches to the regulation of inter-national banking and financial markets.
3. To provide an understanding of future, forwards, swaps and options markets.

### Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module, students should be able, at threshold level, to:
1. Show understanding of the functions and complexity of international banking and financial markets by addressing a realistic problem scenario.
2. Organise and present appropriate data to frame a problem in the area of banking and finance and identify a solution.
3. Show understanding of the issues surrounding the effective regulation of financial systems.
4. Implement strategies involving financial derivatives in measurement and management of financial risk, hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.
5. Critically evaluate and demonstrate knowledge of the empirical research literature in the area
